              I'm a Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer, focusing on <strong>ML interpretability and human-centered AI,
              enhanced through interactive visualization techniques</strong>.

              I received Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, advised by Dr. Polo Chau.
              My PhD research combined machine learning with interactive visualizations to make ML models more interpretable, trustworthy, and safe.
              The core of my research involved:
              <ul>
                <li> Developing interactive visualization systems that scale to <strong>summarize and elucidate concepts learned</strong> by large-scale DNNs. </li>
                <li> Exploring how these concepts <strong>form and evolve during training</strong>, by visually tracking the inception and 
                      evolution of such learned concepts over time.</li>
                <li> Creating interactive tools to <strong>identify and visually explain vulnerabilities</strong> in DNNs, 
                  enhancing understanding of how models can be manipulated or fail when the models are at risk from potential threats. </li>
              </ul>

              After completing my PhD, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Stripe, where I developed AI models tailored for high-stakes environments.
              At stripe, I deveolped advanced ML models for detecting potential fraud, and assessed the impact of AI on users within sensitive financial contexts.

              My PhD research focused on making ML models more interpretable, trustworthy, and safe, 
              through a comprehensive human-centered interpretation of their inner workings, evolution, and vulnerabilities:
              <ul>
                <li> How can we <strong>make sense of complex DNNs</strong>, by uncovering and summarizing the concepts they learn? </li>
