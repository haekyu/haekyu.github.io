<div id="hello">
  <strong>Hello, I'm Haekyu Park</strong>

<div id="about-me">
  I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, 
  working with Dr. <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/">Polo Chau</a>.
  My research goal is to enhance <strong>machine learning interpretability</strong>,
  to promote trust in machine learning models and broaden access for the technologies.
  My research thrusts are:
  <ul>
    <li> Scalable visual discovery for trustworthy and interpretable machine learning
    <li> Actionable insights to protect and troubleshoot models
    <li> Broader machine learning access and education opportunities
  </ul>
  Specifically, I design and develop interactive visual interfaces which help people easily interact with machine learning models.
