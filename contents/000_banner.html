          I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Stripe. Before that, I received Ph.D. in Computer Science at Georgia Tech where I was advised by Dr. Polo Chau.
          My PhD research focuses on addressing fundamental challenges in understanding <b>how machine learning models works</b> and <b>what they have learned</b>: 
          <ul>
            <li> How to scalably discover and summarize concepts that a model has learned? </li>
            <li> How to identify and explain vulnerabilities that the model is susceptible to? </li>
            <li> How do such concepts evolve as the model is trained? </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <!-- My research focuses on three complementary thrusts:
          <ul>
            <li> Scalable visual discovery to interpret AI mechanism </li>
            <li> Insights to protect and troubleshoot models </li>
            <li> Scalable interpretation of concept evolution in AI training </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          Specifically, I create novel tools that enable interactive scalable discovery of concepts, evolutions, and vulnerabilities in deep learning.  -->
          My PhD research was supported by <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2021">JPMorgan AI PhD Fellowship</a>. 
          I have been fortunate to work with amazing researchers, engineers, and scientists at Stripe, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Intel.
