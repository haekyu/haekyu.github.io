            Designed and implemented a deep neural network for 
            detecting fraud transactions, highlighted in <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/how-we-built-it-stripe-radar">this blog</a>. 
            The model's advanced design 
            reduced the time to train our model by over 85% (to less than two hours),
            <!-- resulted in a remarkable  -->
            <!-- <strong>8x increase in training speed</strong>, -->
            significantly increasing the volume of fraud transcations detected.
            <!-- This is expected to result in a  -->
            <!-- <strong>yearly increase of $4-5 million</strong> in fraud detection, -->
            <!-- a substantial improvement over the previous model. -->

              Developed an interactive system enhancing users' ability to re-find previously encountered online information.
              <!-- Developed FoundWright, an interactive system to empowering people 
              to <strong>re-find information</strong> that they have seen before online 
              but that they might have forgotten how to get back to.
              With the support of an advanced language transformer model, 
              FoundWright enables users to effectively express their search queries 
              through <strong>interactive collaboration between the users and the machine learning support</strong>. 
              Our research findings showcase the effectiveness of this innovative approach, 
              as it significantly improves the re-finding process and 
              offers a complementary solution to conventional search methods. -->
