  My research goal is to enhance <strong>machine learning interpretability</strong> to enable:
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Confident use of machine learning</strong>, by helping people interpret and trust the models
    <li> <strong>Effective model debugging and improvement</strong>, by promoting practitioners' understanding of why a model would not work well and providing them insight into how to fix it
    <li> <strong>Broadening access to machine learning</strong>, by encouraging people of diverse backgrounds to easily learn and leverage the technologies.
  </ul>
  Specifically, I design and develop interactive visualization systems to interpret machine learning models.
  I am a member of the <a href="http://poloclub.github.io">Polo Club of Data Science</a> at Georgia Tech. I have been fortunate to work with amazing researchers, engineers, and scientists at NVIDIA and Intel.
