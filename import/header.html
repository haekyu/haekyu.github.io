  <!-- <strong> Research Interests </strong><br> -->
  My research focuses on <strong>democratizing artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> — helping people more easily access, learn, and understand AI technologies. Specifically, I design and build <strong>interactive visual tools</strong> to help people easily <strong>interpret, explore, and apply AI</strong> to many important domain problems. My long-term goal is to cultivate an AI ecosystem where people of diverse backgrounds, skill sets, and domains would work harmoniously to invent the next AI-powered innovations.
